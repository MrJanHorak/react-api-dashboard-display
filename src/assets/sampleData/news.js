The set easily claims the throne, launching with 404,000 equivalent units, according to\nBillboard\n. The title is the third leader for Savage and the twelfth for Drake, and its immediate warm welcome helps him move up once more on an important all-time ranking.\nWith another No. 1 album now included in his discography, Drake breaks out of a tie with Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, and Taylor Swift for the third-most Billboard 200 champions ever. Streisand and Springsteen havent accrued another No. 1 in some time (its been more than half a decade for both), but Swifts winning streak is ongoing.\nIn fact,\nboth artists have collected throughout their careers, as her latest full-length\nMidnights\nopened with the biggest debut of the year just a few weeks ago.\nMidnights\nbecame Swifts eleventh leader less than a month ago, and it helped her tie Drake, Streisand, and Springsteen. Now, she remains steady, while the Canadian hip-hop mogul continues his forward surge. As\nHer Loss\nrules,\nMidnights\nvacates the top spot for the first time, moving to No. 2 with another huge sales frame.\nWith a dozen No. 1 albums to his name, Drake comes in behind only The Beatles (19) and Jay-Z (14) on the list of artists with the most Billboard 200 rulers.\nAmazingly,\nis Drakes second No. 1 album of 2022. His electronic dance-oriented\nHonestly, Nevermind\ndebuted atop the Billboard 200 back in mid-June, bringing his career total up to 11 leaders.

Meanwhile, Drake and 21 Savage just had a massive album of their own, Her Loss, drop recently. With all the buzz around it, it looked like it had a shot of actually repeating Swifts feat.\nNow, though, the top 10 spots of the Hot 100 chart dated November 19 have been revealed, and Drake and 21 managed to get only eight of the top 10 songs. Songs from Her Loss occupy spots No. 2 through No. 9, with Rich Flex coming in at No. 2. Those tracks are sandwiched by Swifts Anti-Hero, which stays at No. 1 for a third week, and Sam Smith and Kim Petras former chart-topper Unholy at No. 10.\nThe #Hot100 top 10 (chart dated Nov. 19, 2022)\n billboard charts (@billboardcharts)\nNovember 14, 2022\nThis comes a little over a year after Drake occupied nine of the top 10 spots on the Hot 100 back in September 2021. So, Drake it now the only artist to simultaneously have at least eight top-10 songs on the chart on two different occasions. With the latest chart, Drake now has a total of 67 career top-10 songs, which extends his record for the most of all time.\nSo, while Drake didnt get No. 1 this week, he still had one of the best frames in Hot 100 chart history. Also, he and 21 Savage did just knock Midnights off the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart.",

Fans hoping to score tickets to the shows know the drill, and its far from easy.\nThe competition began Monday, with hundreds of thousands of Swifties anxiously checking their phones for an email or text from Ticketmasters Verified Fan system.\nFans had until Nov. 9 to register for the Tuesday presale ticket release. On Monday afternoon, fans began receiving emails and texts from Ticketmaster letting them know whether theyve been verified and selected to participate. Without the verification, Swift fans wont have access to early tickets.\nAdvertisement\nBe careful not to delete.

Its gonna be like opening up a college acceptance/rejection letter, one person tweeted.\nAnother person created a Hunger Games logo featuring a fiery Mockingjay and swapped out Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen for a profile of Swift.\nToday in a picture, the person tweeted.\ntoday in a picture\nNovember 14, 2022\nTicket prices are where things could take another unpredictable turn. Prices supposedly range from $49 to $449, before fees, but because demand is so high, the prices could go way up, as plenty of Bruce Springsteens fans will tell you. When Springsteen tickets went on sale over the summer, a wave of would-be buyers were shocked to see prices zoom into the four-figure range for a March show.\nAdvertisement\nIf you dont see something thats comfortable for you, step back, hold on, says Dean Budnick, coauthor of the 2011 book Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped. There might be another opportunity [to buy tickets], whether it is the next day or the next month, or five months from now.\nMay the odds ever(more) be in your favor.",
